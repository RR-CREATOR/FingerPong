**Finger Pong** 

Ping pong game controlled by your index finger.

So open the page and load up the game. Ensure to give camera access, and check if your camera is blocked or not. Then read the instructions by clicking on the respective button and Enjoy.

There are also randomised powerups which appear as yellow balls doing random things like decreasing ball speed, increasing lives, doubling score etc. Also the game may seem slow at first, but play a few levels and it really speeds up and becomes tough. The paddle moves in all dimensions, so be careful of that as well. Also try to keep the paddle still while hitting the ball.

PS: Mediapipe sometimes bugs out, so if it isnt instantly working, please give it 2-3 minutes. If it still isnt working, check console and if there isnt any error, please try restarting and moving your finger closer or further, also check camera. I have tried it multiple times and it takes some time to load up, but after that its working consistently.
